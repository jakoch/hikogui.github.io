When I was working on the font rendering in HikoGUI I found an issue where
the text looked to have a different weight between the light and dark mode
of my application.

{% include figure.html url="/assets/images/posts/the-trouble-with-anti-aliasing-screenshot-linear.png" description="'correct'&nbsp; anti-aliasing in linear-sRGB color space" %}

The rendering above was done inside the SDF (signed distance field)
fragment-shader completely in linear-RGB color space. And as you see
the weight of the text in light-mode is too thin, and the weight in dark-mode
is too bold. 

So why is this happening? According to many articles about font rendering this
is happening because we did the compositing in a gamma color space. However
we did actually render is linear color space, so we have done this correct.

Other articles talk about that fonts are designed to be black-on-white and you
should use stem-darkening. Which is weird because the stem darking is supposed to
be done on the, _already designed for_, black-on-white text.

So I decided to investigate what is really happening here, and in short I found that
when anti-aliasing our eyes expect a perceptional uniform gradient, which does not
happen when mixing the foreground and background color in a linear-RGB space.

Doing the calculation
---------------------
In this chapter I will show why a \\(1\\) pixel wide white line and a black background
will visual look like a \\(1.46\\) pixel wide line after anti-aliasing in
linear-RGB color space.

For this example we will draw a one pixel wide vertical line with its center
at \\(x = 1.75\\). The line is white on a black background, which means that
the alpha of a pixel can be directly translated into linear luminance values.

But since our eyes do not perceive luminance values as linear we will need
to convert these values to lightness values using the formula from CIE L\*a\*b\* 1976.
I filled in \\(Y_n = 1.0\\) into the formula and normalized \\(L\\) between \\(0.0\\)
and \\(1.0\\) to make it easier to work with:

$$
L =
\begin{cases}
    1.16 \cdot \sqrt[3]{Y} - 0.16 & \text{if } Y > 0.00885\\
\\
    9.03297 \cdot Y & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

In the table below you can see a horizontal strip of 4 pixels, with the
linear luminance values and the perceptional uniform lightness values.
As you see our intended vertical line is \\(1\\) pixel wide. But after
we calculated what a human eye really perceives we find that the line is visually
\\(1.46\\) pixels wide.

Don't: anti-alias in the sRGB color space
-----------------------------------------
At this point you may think, okay... anti-alias instead in the sRGB color space.
The sRGB's transfer function (gamma), by design, already approximates the perceived lightness.

This will actually work, up to a point. Many font rendering engines do this, probably after
having experimented with linear anti-aliasing and not getting the desired results. And even
image editors used to compose in a similar non-linear color spaces in the past.

However instead of a uniform gradient between the foreground and the background the colors
may get seriously distorted. When using red on a green background for example the gradient
passes into dark brown colors as shown in the image below.

Do: anti-alias in CIE L\*a\*b\* color space
-------------------------------------------
So we can't blend in either a linear-RGB space, nor in a uniform-RGB space. What we would like is a color
space that allows us to blend the perceptional uniform lightness together with linear colors.

The CIE L\*a\*b\* color space has a perceptional uniform lightness in one axis and a separate
perceptional uniform color plane. The CIE L\*a\*b\* color space may be a valid color space
to do anti-aliasing in, but it is computational expensive.

Do: Convert coverage to alpha with perceptional compensation
------------------------------------------------------------
Lets try something cheaper.

We would like to be able to use the following GPU features:
 - Fixed-function Linear alpha blending
 - Per color channel alpha blending (can be used for sub-pixel anti-aliasing).
 - Don't read the destination frame-buffer in the shader.

If we want to use the alpha channel, we need to convert the coverage value to the alpha value
by looking at the perceptional lightness of the foreground and background color.

The following formulas are used to convert a coverage value to an alpha value when both
the background and foreground colors are known:

  variable       | description
 :-------------- |:-----------
  \\(c\\)        | coverage; The amount a pixel is covered by the glyph.
  \\(F\\)        | foreground luminance (linear).
  \\(B\\)        | background luminance (linear).
  \\(T\\)        | target luminance (linear).
  \\(\bar{F}\\)  | foreground lightness (perceptional).
  \\(\bar{B}\\)  | background lightness (perceptional).
  \\(\bar{T}\\)  | target lightness (perceptional).
  \\(a\\)        | perceptional compensated alpha value.

$$
\begin{align*}
\bar{F} &= \sqrt(F) \\
\bar{B} &= \sqrt(B) \\
\bar{T} &= \text{mix}(\bar{F}, \bar{B}, c) \\
T &= \bar{T}^2 \\
a &=
\begin{cases}
    \frac{T - B}{F - B} & \text{if } F != B \\
    c & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$

However we do not know what the background color of the text is, So instead
we expect that the text will be contrasting with the background.

After filling in \\(F = 0, B = 1\)) and \((F = 1, B = 0\\) in the formulas above and
simplify it we get two coverage-to-alpha formulas.

Then we linear interpolate `mix()` between the coverage-to-alpha formulas for
black-on-white and white-on-black, by the perceptional uniform foreground lightness.

  variable       | description
 :-------------- |:-----------
  \\(c\\)        | coverage; The amount a pixel is covered by the glyph.
  \\(\bar{F}\\)  | foreground lightness (perceptional).
  \\(a_w\\)      | alpha for white text on black background.
  \\(a_b\\)      | alpha for black text on white background.
  \\(a\\)        | perceptional compensated alpha value.

$$
\begin{align*}
a_w &= c^2 \\
a_b &= 2c - c^2 \\
a &= \text{mix}(a_b, a_w, \bar{F})
\end{align*}
$$

In GLSL this is simply:

```
float coverage_to_alpha(float coverage, float sqrt_foreground)
{
    float coverage_sq = coverage * coverage;
    float coverage_2 = coverage + coverage;
    return mix(coverage_2 - coverage_sq, coverage_sq, sqrt_foreground);
}
```

Terms

### Linear-sRGB color space
Linear-sRGB is an inaccurate term describing a color space based on
the sRGB color primaries and white point, but with a linear transfer function.

The color component values have a range between \\(0.0\\) and \\(1.0\\) and are represented
as floating point values. In certain cases values outside the \\(0.0\\) to \\(1.0\\) range
are allowed to handle luminance values beyond \\(80 cd/m^2\\) for HDR, or negative values
which represent colors outside the triangle of the sRGB color primaries.

This is the color space that is used inside fragment shaders on a GPU.

### Luminance (Y)
The luminance is a physical linear indication of brightness.

In this paper we use the range of luminance values between \\(0.0\\) and \\(1.0\\) to
be mapped linear to \\(0 cd/m^2\\) to \\(80 cd/m^2\\); which is the standard range of
sRGB screen-luminance-level.

The luminance value is calculated from the linear-sRGB values as follows:

$$ Y = 0.2126 * R + 0.7152 * G + 0.0722 * B $$

My intuition of luminance calculations in high-gamut extended-sRGB color space
is that the luminance is always positive. Since if a color outside the standard-sRGB
triangle is selected at least one of the components must be a positive enough
value to force the luminance to be above zero. Having only positive values is important
for taking the square root, see the next section.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_luminance>

### Lightness (L)
Lightness is the perceptual uniform indication of brightness.

In this blog post we use the range of lightness values between \\(0.0\\) and \\(1.0\\) to
be mapped non-linear to \\(0 cd/m^2\\) to \\(80 cd/m^2\\).  which is the standard range of
[sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) screen-luminance-level.

The formula to convert luminance to CIE L\*a\*b\* lightness value is:

$$
f(t) =
\begin{cases}
    \sqrt[3]{t} & \text{if } t > ( \frac{6}{29} )^3
\\
    \frac{1}{3} ( \frac{29}{6} )^2 t + \frac{4}{29} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$ L = 1.16 f \left( \dfrac{Y}{Y_n} \right) - 0.16 $$

The formula below is an approximation made in 1920, which is much faster to calculate
in hardware.

$$ L = \sqrt{Y} $$

$$ Y = L * L $$
